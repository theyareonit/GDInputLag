#2.1 only, 2.2 doesnt need it

to download the mod click the link under Releases on the right -->

THIS IS NOT NEEDED IF YOU USE MEGA HACK v7.1.1 OR ABOVE, ABSOLUTE ADDED AN OPTION THAT DOES THE SAME THING

make sure you have MinHook.x86.dll in your GD folder (the same folder as GeometryDash.exe), if not then download this zip and use the MinHook.x86.dll from the bin folder https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/releases/download/v1.3.3/MinHook_133_bin.zip

if everything is working properly, and you use mega hack, a tab called Input Lag should show up. if it doesnt, you did it wrong. ensure that inputlag.dll is in your extensions folder and MinHook.x86.dll is in your gd folder (not your extensions folder). 

it also works even without mega hack, you can use any dll loader as long as u have MinHook.x86.dll in the right place.

i was gonna bundle another much more complicated mod with this but it was taking too long to make so i'm just releasing this one on its own for now. i will also actually have the cmakelists & libraries in the github repo once that part is done (sorry for not having them already i barely know how to use git).
